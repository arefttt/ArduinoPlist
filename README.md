# ArduinoPlist Library

## Introduction
The ArduinoPlist library is a user-friendly library for Arduino that allows you to work with plist (property list) files. Plist files are commonly used in macOS and iOS environments to store serialized objects. They can be in binary format or XML format.

## Features
The ArduinoPlist library provides the following features:

- **Create plist files**: You can create a new plist file using the `create()` method.
- **Write data to plist files**: You can write data to a plist file using the `write(String data)` method.
- **Delete plist files**: You can delete a plist file using the `deletePlist()` method.
- **Validate plist files**: You can check if a plist file is valid using the `isValid()` method.
- **Parse plist files**: You can parse a plist file and return its contents as a string using the `parse()` method.
- **Find data in plist files**: You can find and return data associated with a given key using the `find(String key)` method.
- **Remove keys from plist files**: You can remove a specific key from a plist file using the `removeKey(String key)` method.
- **Check for keys in plist files**: You can check if a specific key exists in a plist file using the `checkKey(String key)` method.

## Usage
Here's an example of how you might use the ArduinoPlist library:

```cpp
#include <ArduinoPlist.h>

ArduinoPlist myPlist("myFile.plist");

if (!myPlist.create()) {
  Serial.println("Failed to create plist file.");
}

if (!myPlist.write("Hello, world!")) {
  Serial.println("Failed to write to plist file.");
}

if (myPlist.isValid()) {
  String data = myPlist.parse();
  Serial.println(data);
}
```

## Limitations
Please note that Arduino has limited resources, so it might not be able to handle large plist files or complex parsing tasks. If you're working with large or complex plist files, you might need to use a more powerful microcontroller or single-board computer.
